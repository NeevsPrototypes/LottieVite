# React + TypeScript + Vite + LottieFiles

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. Our focus is to show how a Lottie image works on a React project properly.

# How to setup
1. Clone the project on your local machine
2. Insert on your terminal the command: ```npm i --legacy-peer-deps``` and wait for the installation
3. Go to ```src``` folder 
4. Run this command: ```npm run dev```

...and that's all!
